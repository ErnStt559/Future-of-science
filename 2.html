<h1>🧫 Bacteria That Eat Plastic: Will Microbes Save the Planet?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
      Scientists have created bacteria capable of breaking down plastic.  
      Perhaps they will help clean the Earth from waste that has been accumulating for decades.

<p>Imagine: oceans without plastic islands, beaches without bottles, and trash that disappears — not in 500 years, but in just a few days.</p>
<p>Science fiction? Scientists say — not anymore.  
    Science has created bacteria that eat plastic.  
    And perhaps they will be humanity’s last chance to clean the Earth of the waste we’ve produced for decades.</p>
<h2>♻️ How the “Plastic-Eating” Bacteria Was Discovered</h2>
<p>It all began in 2016, when Japanese researchers collected soil samples near a PET bottle recycling plant in Sakai.  
    Among the microbes that had adapted to life in a toxic environment, they discovered a microbe that lived by feeding on plastic.</p>
<p>It was named <strong>Ideonella sakaiensis</strong>.  
    It produces an enzyme called PETase, which breaks down polyethylene terephthalate (the same PET used in bottles and packaging)  
    into simple substances that the microbe then “eats.”</p>
<p>This was a sensation: what takes hundreds of years to decompose in nature, the bacterium can process in just a few days under the right conditions.  
    In the lab, a thin PET film completely dissolved in 6 weeks — a record that no chemical catalyst had achieved before.</p>
<h2>🧠 AI Accelerated Evolution</h2>
<p>Scientists decided to improve the enzyme using artificial intelligence.  
    Algorithms analyzed the structure of PETase and suggested dozens of possible mutations to make the enzyme faster and more heat-resistant.</p>
<p>In 2022, researchers from the University of Texas created a version called <strong>FAST-PETase</strong>,  
    which can break down plastic within 24 hours at 50 °C — a temperature at which ordinary enzymes would simply denature.</p>
<p>This means that a ton of waste can literally disappear in a single day.  
    In pilot tests, 90 % of PET bottles turned into monomers — the building blocks for new plastic — in less than 48 hours.</p>
<h2>🌊 Oceans, Landfills, and Laboratories</h2>
<p>Experiments are now underway to integrate these enzymes into water purification and recycling systems.  
    French company Carbios has already launched the world’s first industrial bioreactor that processes 250 kg of plastic per day using modified PETase.</p>
<p>The idea is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>collect plastic,</li>
<li>shred it,</li>
<li>add the enzyme,</li>
<li>and then use the resulting molecules to create new plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a closed recycling loop — no burning, no landfills, just reuse.  
    The resulting material is indistinguishable from virgin plastic, but its carbon footprint is 60 % lower.</p>
<h2>🔬 Other “Waste-Eating” Organisms</h2>
<ul>
<li>🦠 <strong>Pseudomonas putida</strong> — a bacterium that turns plastic into biofuel; in 2024, it was used to produce 1 liter of biokerosene from 3 kg of waste;</li>
<li>🍄 Plastic-eating fungi (<em>Aspergillus tubingensis</em>) — discovered in a Pakistani landfill, can grow directly on trash and degrade polyurethane in 2 months;</li>
<li>🌿 Genetically modified <em>E. coli</em> that convert PET waste into vanillin — the same substance that gives vanilla its flavor. Yes, your ice cream may soon be made from old bottles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>⚠️ Why It’s Not Used Everywhere Yet</h2>
<p>Real oceans are complex ecosystems — things aren’t so simple.  
    Bacteria need to be “kept under control” so they don’t disrupt the balance.  
    Large-scale use requires safe bioreactors and strict safety protocols.</p>
<blockquote>“We can’t just release bacteria into the ocean and hope they’ll eat everything.  
    We need closed systems where every microbe is accounted for.”  
    <cite>— Dr. Kohei Oda, lead researcher of the Ideonella sakaiensis project</cite></blockquote>
<p>Another problem: enzymes only work on certain types of plastic.  
    Polyethylene (bags, films) and polypropylene (containers) are still “inedible.”  
    But AI is already training on new datasets — the next version of FAST-PETase will “learn” to digest LDPE by 2026.</p>
<h2>💡 What’s Next</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating biofactories that recycle plastic using enzymes — the first such plant opens in Lyon in 2025;</li>
<li>Using AI to search for new microbes in soil, ice, and deep-sea trenches — the “microbial dark matter” project has already found 12 promising strains;</li>
<li>Developing “smart” containers where waste decomposes on its own — Adidas is testing sneakers that dissolve in a compost bin in 72 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps in 20 years, landfills will turn into laboratories —  
    not places where we bury problems underground, but where we grow solutions from them.</p>
