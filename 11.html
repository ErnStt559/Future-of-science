    <h1>AI Created a Drug Faster Than a Pharma Company in 10 Years</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Artificial intelligence is completely transforming the pharmaceutical industry — now drugs are created not in years, but in weeks.

    <p>Imagine: a drug that took <strong>10 years and $2.6 billion</strong> to develop —  
    now takes <strong>46 days and $150,000</strong>.</p>

    <p>Sounds like science fiction?  
    It’s <strong>2025</strong>.  
    And it’s already happened.</p>

    <h2>From “Guessing” to Molecular Precision</h2>
    <p>Traditional drug discovery: <strong>10,000 compounds → 1 approved drug</strong>.  
    A decade of wet-lab failures.  
    Billions wasted.</p>

    <p>AI doesn’t guess.  
    It <strong>generates</strong>.</p>

    <p>Feed it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Target protein structure (from AlphaFold 3);</li>
      <li>Binding pocket geometry;</li>
      <li>ADMET profile (absorption, toxicity, etc.);</li>
      <li>Known drug databases (ChEMBL, PubChem).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Output: <strong>a novel, synthesizable molecule</strong> — optimized for potency, selectivity, and safety — <strong>in minutes</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How It Works — The AI Drug Pipeline</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Target ID</strong>: AI scans 20,000 human proteins → picks the best disease driver;</li>
      <li><strong>Hit Generation</strong>: Generative AI (VAEs, GANs, diffusion models) creates 10⁶ candidates;</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual Screening</strong>: Quantum-accurate docking + ML predicts binding affinity;</li>
      <li><strong>Lead Optimization</strong>: Reinforcement learning refines top 100 molecules;</li>
      <li><strong>Synthesis Planning</strong>: AI designs 3-step route using robotic labs.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Total time: <strong>30–90 days</strong> from target to preclinical candidate.</p>

    <h2>Real Breakthroughs — Real Drugs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Insilico Medicine (2023)</strong><br>
        <strong>ISM3312</strong> — AI-designed drug for <strong>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</strong>.  
        From target to <strong>IND filing: 18 months</strong> (vs. 5–7 years).  
        Phase II ongoing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exscientia + Sumitomo (2024)</strong><br>
        <strong>EXS-21546</strong> — AI-discovered oncology drug.  
        <strong>First AI-designed molecule in human trials</strong>.  
        <strong>Cost: $5.2M</strong> (vs. $100M+ traditionally).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Generate:Biomedicines (2025)</strong><br>
        <strong>GB-1211</strong> — AI-generated antibody for pancreatic cancer.  
        Designed in <strong>11 days</strong>.  
        Enters clinic <strong>Q4 2025</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why This Is a Revolution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cost</strong>: <strong>90% reduction</strong> in R&D spend;</li>
      <li><strong>Speed</strong>: <strong>100x faster</strong> from idea to clinic;</li>
      <li><strong>Success rate</strong>: <strong>30–40%</strong> in Phase I (vs. 5–10% historically);</li>
      <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: AI designs drugs for <em>your</em> mutation profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In 2025, <strong>Merck and NVIDIA</strong> launched <strong>DrugGPT</strong> — an open-source model that lets any researcher generate drug candidates via text prompt.</p>

    <h2>But the Risks Are Real — And Terrifying</h2>
    <p>In 2022, a collaboration between <strong>Collaborations Pharmaceuticals</strong> and a bioethics group asked an AI to design <strong>toxins</strong>.</p>

    <p>Result: <strong>40,000 lethal molecules</strong> — including <strong>VX nerve agent variants</strong> — in <strong>6 hours</strong>.</p>

    <p>The paper was <strong>nearly censored</strong>.  
    The model was <strong>never released</strong>.</p>

    <p>Now, every major AI drug platform has <strong>“red team” safety layers</strong> — but the dual-use risk remains.</p>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2026</strong>: First <strong>FDA-approved AI-native drug</strong>;</li>
      <li><strong>2028</strong>: <strong>AI pharmacists</strong> — prescribe custom molecules via app;</li>
      <li><strong>2030</strong>: <strong>End of blockbuster drugs</strong> — every patient gets a unique compound.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The era of <strong>one drug for millions</strong> is over.  
    The era of <strong>one drug for one genome</strong> has begun.</p>

      but by the intelligence humans created.”
