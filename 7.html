      A camera, processor, and neural implant help restore vision to people who lost it due to disease or injury.

<p>Imagine a world of total darkness — for decades.  
    Then one day, a surgeon places a tiny chip on your retina or directly into your visual cortex.  
    You open your eyes — and for the first time, <strong>you see light</strong>.  
    A glowing doorway. A hand waving. A face smiling.</p>
<p>This is not science fiction.  
    This is <strong>2025</strong>.  
    And it’s already happening.</p>
<h2>How the Bionic Eye Works</h2>
<p>The bionic eye is a <strong>neurovisual prosthesis</strong> — a bridge between the physical world and the brain.  
    It consists of three core components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>External camera</strong> — mounted on glasses, captures real-time video;</li>
<li><strong>AI vision processor</strong> — converts pixels into simplified electrical patterns (like Morse code for the brain);</li>
<li><strong>Neural implant</strong> — either on the retina (<em>epiretinal</em>), under it (<em>subretinal</em>), or directly in the <strong>visual cortex</strong> via penetrating electrodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The brain doesn’t need perfect eyes — it just needs <strong>patterns</strong>.  
    And it’s astonishingly good at learning them.</p>
<h2>Scientific Magic: The Brain Learns to See</h2>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the key.  
    Even in people blind for 50+ years, the visual cortex remains <strong>primed for sight</strong>.  
    When stimulated with electrical pulses, it begins to <em>interpret</em> — first as flashes (phosphenes), then as edges, motion, and finally — meaningful shapes.</p>
<p>In clinical trials, patients report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: “I saw sparks.”</li>
<li>Week 2: “I can tell where the window is.”</li>
<li>Month 3: “I recognized my wife’s silhouette.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The brain <strong>rewires itself</strong> — just like a child learning to see.</p>
<h2>Real Achievements — Real People Seeing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Argus II (Second Sight, FDA-approved 2013)</strong><br/>
        60-electrode retinal implant.  
        <strong>Over 350 patients</strong> worldwide.  
        Allows navigation, reading large letters, and recognizing doorways.
      </li>
<li>
<strong>PRIMA (Pixium Vision, France)</strong><br/>
        Subretinal photovoltaic chip — no external wires.  
        378 pixels.  
        Patients can <strong>recognize faces and read clocks</strong> in 2024 trials.
      </li>
<li>
<strong>Orion (Second Sight + UCLA, 2024–2025)</strong><br/>
<strong>First cortical visual prosthesis</strong>.  
        60 electrodes directly in V1 (primary visual cortex).  
        Works even if eyes and optic nerves are completely destroyed.  
        In 2025, a 100-electrode version restored <strong>functional central vision</strong> in two fully blind volunteers.
      </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
      “I saw light, and then — the outline of a table.  
      It’s like opening your eyes for the first time… at 68 years old.”  
      <cite>— Terry (Orion trial participant, blind for 47 years)</cite>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independence</strong>: Patients pour coffee, cross streets, and hug loved ones with confidence;</li>
<li><strong>Proof of concept</strong>: Direct brain interfaces work — paving the way for memory, hearing, and motor restoration;</li>
<li><strong>Augmented future</strong>: Tomorrow’s implants may stream data, night vision, or even <strong>AR overlays</strong> directly into perception.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations — The Honest Truth</h2>
<p>Current systems are not 20/20 vision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolution: <strong>60–400 pixels</strong> (like a 90s Game Boy screen);</li>
<li>No color (yet): Only grayscale phosphenes;</li>
<li>Surgery risk: Brain or retinal implantation carries infection and rejection risks;</li>
<li>Cost: $150,000–$300,000 per system — not widely covered by insurance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
      “We’re giving people the ability to see, but not yet as before.  
      It’s like a black-and-white TV picture instead of the real world.”  
      <cite>— Dr. Nader Pouratian, UCLA Neurosurgery</cite>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Future of Bionic Eyes</h2>
<p>The roadmap is accelerating:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2027</strong>: 1,000+ electrode cortical arrays (Science Corp, Neuralink);</li>
<li><strong>2028</strong>: First <strong>color vision</strong> via multi-wavelength stimulation;</li>
<li><strong>2030</strong>: AI-enhanced implants that <strong>recognize objects and faces in real time</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>2035</strong>: Wireless, fully internal systems — no glasses, no cables.</li>
</ul>
<p>One day, blindness may not just be treatable —  
    it may be <strong>optional</strong>.</p>
